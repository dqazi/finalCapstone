This code implements a shoe inventory system with a Shoe class and several functions for manipulating the inventory. The Shoe class has properties for country, code, product, cost, and quantity. The functions implemented in the code include:

init method: A constructor method for the Shoe class that initializes properties for country, code, product, cost, and quantity.
get_cost method: A method that returns the cost of the shoe.
get_quantity method: A method that returns the quantity of the shoe.
str method: A method that returns a formatted string with the object's properties.
read_shoes_data function: A function that reads an inventory.txt file and populates a shoes_list with shoe objects.
capture_shoes function: A function that captures new shoe data from the user and appends it to the shoes_list and inventory.txt file.
view_all function: A function that prints all shoe objects in the shoes_list.
re_stock function: A function that finds the shoe with the lowest quantity and allows the user to add to the quantity.
search_shoe function: A function that searches for a shoe object in the shoes_list based on the shoe code.
The program reads the inventory.txt file on startup and populates the shoes_list with Shoe objects. The user can then choose to capture new shoe data, view all shoes in the inventory, restock the inventory, or search for a shoe by code.
